Project 4 Predicting Heart Disease

## Overview
The industry selected by the analysis team was healthcare. 

## Questions
What are the best clinical variables for predicting the probability of heart disease?  
The variables include, demographics (age, sex), EKG data, and other heart condition related variables   
Inform patients what are the highest risk factors in developing heart disease  
This data could be used to advice, provide interventions, treatment plans   

## Timeline of Activities/Things Learned
1005 Created and submitted proposal for project  

1009 Created some Tableau visuals of data to understand relationships between variables
